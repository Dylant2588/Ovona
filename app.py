Create a meal plan for {days} days, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Each meal should include a calorie estimate. Keep it simple and repeatable when possible.
Output in a clear, easy-to-read format. I also need you to think of things like, when last did this person have Fish? Etc, and rotate that into their diet for micro nutrients.
